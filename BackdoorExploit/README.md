# BackdoorExploit

BackdoorExploit is a very simple mod with only one feature: it adds a "backdoor virus" that can be installed on computers in order to _silently_ acquire admin permissions. Usage is simple, and extensions are able to limit functionality.

## Acquisition

By default, the exe will just be given to you the first time your OS loads after installing the mod, as `/bin/Backdoor.exe` on the player's computer. This will then set the flag `ADDED_BACKDOOR_EXE` to prevent it from being re-added, such as if an extension mission makes the player lose it.

If an extension wants to control when the player gets the program, the flag `NO_ADD_BACKDOOR_EXE` will disable the above behaviour.

## Usage

The program is semi-intelligent, handling both installation and activation of the backdoor exploit on whatever computer the user is connected to. However, the checks are intentionally very simple: if the user has admin access on the target, the exploit will be _installed_; if the user doesn't have admin access, the exploit will be _triggered_.

This means that if the exploit is already installed, running `Backdoor` again will have no effect. If you attempt to _trigger_ the exploit on a computer that doesn't have it, the program will take the _full_ execution time, only to report failure at the end. Since `Backdoor` takes very little RAM, there are no checks performed for early-exit or redudant-installation in order to fit as more "realistic". The tradeoff is cheaper execution but no convenience checks.

However, since `Backdoor` does _not_ count as a hostile action (regardless of what it does _or_ doesn't do), you lose nothing in trying to trigger the exploit on a system you aren't sure about, unless of course you're in ETAS or something similar.

### Limiting Usage

Extensions can control how the player can use `Backdoor` by setting and unsetting two specific flags:

- `NO_INSTALL_BACKDOOR` will prevent the program from installing the exploit.
	- This can be used to limit which computers have the exploit, with a critical caveat:
	- The exploit is a specific file with specific content, on the target system. There's nothing preventing the player from simply downloading that file from an "infected" system, breaking into a "clean" system (the normal way), and replacing the "clean" file with the "infected" one.
	- On the other hand, this may be a desired feature, by making the backdoor installation feel more "realistic" and "hacker-y" instead of a fully automated process.
- `NO_TRIGGER_BACKDOOR` will prevent the program from _using_ the exploit.
	- This may sound strange, but it would allow a custom mission to create an objective where a particular system must be "infected" with the exploit in order to progress.
	- On the other hand, as mentioned above, it's also just a specific file with specific content, so you could accomplish the same thing by making the player upload a file instead.

## Configuration

At present, nothing is configurable. Future plans already include making execution times configurable, changing the file name/path for the exploit, and possibly changing the RAM cost.

## Debugging and Testing

At present, the exploit file's name is unchangeable, but it varies between _debug_ and _release_ builds of the mod. In release builds, the filename is `netcfgx.dll`, which is one of the files always generated in filesystems for all computers. This was chosen to imitate the "realism" of having to "infect" a networking library file with your virus. In debug builds, for ease of testing, the file is instead `sysv.dll`, to make it not _totally_ immersion breaking (nobody would leave a `backdoor.dll` file alone) while still making it easy to spot (and delete) at a glance.
